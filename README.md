# HotBugs.jar: A Diverse Dataset of Time-Critcal Bugs for Java Hot Fixing

HotBugs.jar is built as an extension of the widely used [Bugs.jar](https://github.com/bugs-dot-jar/bugs-dot-jar) dataset. It is composed of a set of Apache Java time-critical bugs that were addressed with a hot fix. It introduces a more focused subset of bugs based on urgency and impact. Each included bug is labeled as high priority in its corresponding Jira issue, was resolved within a short time frame from issue creation, and is associated with a nearby release tag in the project's version history. This focus makes HotBugs.jar especially suited for studying rapid bug resolution, automated repair under production pressure, and tools for emergency software maintenance.

## How To Install

For the first time, you should clone this repository as well as its submodules:
```
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/carolhanna01/HotBugs-dot-jar
```

To update the dataset, don't forget to update the submodules as well:
```
$ git pull --recurse-submodules && git submodule update --recursive
```

## Directory & File Structure
To browse a specific bug data, please go to one of the following project directories and select a branch starting with "bugs-dot-jar-" and ending with "\_HOTFIX".  The branch names follow the format: "bugs-dot-jar\_\[JIRA Issue ID\]\_\[Git commit ID of the fixed version\]\_HOTFIX.  Each branch in a project represents the buggy version corresponding to the JIRA Issue and also includes the bug report, the developer patch, and the test results under `.bugs-dot-jar` directory.
